# Learning Data Structures and Algorithms with LeetCode

## Overview:

This repository is aimed at providing a structured approach to learning and practicing various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) concepts using LeetCode, a popular platform for coding interviews preparation. 

## How to Use:

1. **Select a Topic**: Choose a specific DSA topic you want to learn or practice, such as arrays, linked lists, sorting algorithms, searching algorithms, etc.

2. **Explore Problems**: Go through the problems related to the chosen topic on LeetCode. LeetCode provides a vast collection of problems categorized by topics. 

3. **Read Solutions**: Attempt to solve the problems on your own first. Afterward, explore the solutions provided by other users. Understand the approaches and techniques used in solving the problems.

4. **Implement Solutions**: Implement the solutions on your own. Try to understand the code thoroughly and run it against test cases to ensure correctness.

5. **Analyze Time and Space Complexity**: Analyze the time and space complexity of the solutions you implemented. Understanding these complexities is crucial for optimizing code.

6. **Experiment and Optimize**: Experiment with different approaches to solving the same problem. Try to optimize your solutions to achieve better time and space complexities.

7. **Repeat**: Repeat this process for different DSA topics, gradually increasing the difficulty level of problems as you gain proficiency.

## Folder Structure:

- **Arrays**: Contains problems related to arrays.
- **Linked Lists**: Contains problems related to linked lists.
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Contains problems related to sorting algorithms.
- **Searching Algorithms**: Contains problems related to searching algorithms.
- **Trees and Graphs**: Contains problems related to trees and graphs.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Contains problems related to dynamic programming.
- **Miscellaneous**: Contains miscellaneous DSA problems.
