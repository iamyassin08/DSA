# Reverse String

## Problem Statement

Given a string, write a function that reverses the characters in the string in place.

### Example:

Input: "hello"
Output: "olleh"

Input: "world"
Output: "dlrow"

## Approach

To reverse the string in place, we can use two pointers technique. We'll have one pointer starting from the beginning of the string and another pointer starting from the end of the string. We'll swap the characters at these pointers and move them towards each other until they meet in the middle of the string.

### Algorithm:

1. Initialize two pointers, one pointing to the beginning of the string (let's call it `left`) and another pointing to the end of the string (let's call it `right`).
2. While `left` is less than `right`, swap the characters at `left` and `right`.
3. Move `left` one position to the right and `right` one position to the left.
4. Repeat steps 2-3 until `left` is no longer less than `right`.

### Complexity Analysis:

- Time Complexity: O(n) - where n is the length of the string.
- Space Complexity: O(1) - no extra space is used.

## Implementation

You can find a sample implementation of the Reverse String problem in various programming languages in the respective directories.
